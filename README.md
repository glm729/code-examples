# Code Examples

README as at 2021-04-16.

Any constructive comments on how to improve my skills, knowledge, or best
practice are most welcome, provided that reasoning is given.  For example,
instead of saying "Do it this way", I recommend providing a bit of reasoning
and logic to accompany it, e.g. "Do it this way, because it's faster / uses
less RAM / is the common convention".


## The Short

I am a graduate mathematician / statistician and I enjoy experimenting with
scripting languages.  Initially learning and using R while studying statistics,
then Python for study and work, I then tried Ruby and Julia, and at work I have
been using JavaScript and Ruby quite a lot, and recently Julia.  For Ruby and
Julia, I think I'm not very good at either, but it's fun to try and I'd like to
learn more.  I'm certainly open to learning new languages, but I am not
confident that I could pick up a lower-level language (e.g. C, FORTRAN)
particularly quickly.


## The Long


### Personal background

I am a recent graduate of a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Statistics,
at Murdoch University, Perth, Western Australia, during which I completed three
projects in veterinary biostatistics.  I am currently an Assistant Data Analyst
at the Australian National Phenome Centre (ANPC), and my previous position was
Software Tester at the Centre for Comparative Genomics (CCG).

My home computer is a Raspberry Pi 4 with Ubuntu MATE and i3.  This is not the
computer I use at work, but is more than suitable for the vast majority of
things I do (even at work, possibly, but don't hold me to that), except maybe
it's not so great with 720p+ on Youtube.  All in all, I adore the Raspberry Pi
4, and I only use it as a desktop computer, so I can only imagine the
possibilities for extension.


### Coding background

#### Summary

I typically work with R for statistics, Python for testing in my previous
position, and Ruby for data handling and manipulation.  Changes to my current
role have resulted in most of my work being completed in JavaScript and Ruby,
for user interface development and for data handling and manipulation, and I've
been experimenting with Julia.  I have otherwise played around with R for
things like recording timesheets, Python for things like implementations of the
Syracuse and Euclid algorithms, and have used bash for cleaning input (and
providing a bit of fancy output) for the youtube-dl program (just as a thought
exercise, I guess).  I've recently been playing around with Ruby a little bit,
as well as using it quite a bit at work, and have uploaded some scripts for a
couple of things, including Syracuse and Euclid implementations.  Recently, I'm
learning JavaScript at work for data handling and manipulation, and I find its
syntax can parallel surprisingly with Ruby, which has helped me to pick up
basic JS fairly quickly.  I've also recently been trying Julia for a few things
at work, mainly data handling.

In essence, I learned the basics of R when studying statstics, Python when
studying mathematical modelling and when working at the CCG, and Ruby when
working at the CCG and the ANPC as well as out of personal interest.  Recent
changes at work resulted in me learning a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
mainly for data handling but also to assist in building small test pages for
certain functions or operations.  I can also provide code assistance and
documentation, which I enjoy because I miss teaching mathematics and
statistics.


#### R

I started using R in the first half of 2018, when I studied MAS224
Biostatistical Methods at Murdoch University, co-ordinated by Dr. Nicola J.
Armstrong.  I used R for most semesters in my undergrad since studying this
unit, including for summer scholarship projects for Murdoch University and for
the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute.  Both projects were in
veterinary biostatistics, as was an undergraduate project in my final semester.
The first project was an investigation into factors affecting survival of dogs
in veterinary trauma cases presenting to emergency and critical care, mainly in
the US.  The second project was a supplementary analysis for the application of
a robust parameter estimation technique in estimating hormone levels in equine
blood plasma samples to diagnose a common degenerative disorder.  My work on
this project resulted in co-authorship on the paper (*Clinically and temporally
specific diagnostic thresholds for plasma ACTH in the horse*, Equine Veterinary
Journal; [doi:10.1111/evj.13292](https://doi.org/10.1111/evj.13292)) for
extending the visualisations produced for my presentation at the Australian
Mathematical Sciences Institute in early 2020.  The final project aimed to
apply text mining techniques to a national veterinary database to monitor
vaccination scheduling for working dogs in Australia.  I didn't get very far,
and I would like to improve upon it if I can find the time.


#### Python

I began using Python in mid-2019, shortly into my employment as Research
Assistant at the Centre for Comparative Genomics.  I completed CSC2410
Computational Thinking with Python at the University of Southern Queensland,
via online study, in the second semester of 2019, which was mostly based upon
Downey's *Modeling and Simulation in Python*.  Automated testing of the Rare
Disease Registry Framework primarily uses the Python packages Aloe and
Selenium.  I have written scripts for automation of the Patient Reported
Outcomes (PROMS) surveys, which were modified to accept input data via CSV as
requested by Lee Render (see [@id2359](https://github.com/id2359)), using the
Selenium package.  I have written new features and steps for extending current
testing routines, including introducing tests for an additional registry which
was not previously covered, using the Aloe framework.  One example is provided
here, currently, but is now quite out of date.  A number of additional steps
(and associated feature files) have been produced since this first published
example.  I also made some minor modifications to a couple of unit tests,
introducing a small set of sub-tests for a couple of operations, but I didn't
go too deep there.


#### Other languages

I am definitely open to learning more programming languages, though I have not
tried lower-level languages.  I have tended to stick to high-level languages,
or scripting languages.  As such, while I am still curious to learn, it will
likely take me quite a bit longer to get the hang of lower-level languages,
such as C or FORTRAN.  For high-level languages, I have been playing around and
working with Ruby and Julia, and I've been doing some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
at work, for designing a web-style interface for data handling, analysis, and
visualisation.


### Editor

I have changed editors a few times.  I have worked with MATLAB, Octave, and
Jupyter Notebook when studying Mathematical Modelling.  Otherwise, I have used
RStudio, Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Emacs.  For a while, particularly
earlier last year, I used Emacs for most things I was doing.  I now prefer to
use Vim, though I'm far from knowledgeable about how to properly use it.  I
have also been using the Atom editor at work (until I swapped to i3wm, which
Atom doesn't like, it seems), but I still prefer Vim.  For cross-platform or
company-wide usage and code demonstration, it has been recommended to set up
the code and documentation together in Jupyter Notebooks, which, given my
experience with the system, I think is a very good idea, but I don't yet know
how to properly make use of the power of the Jupyter Notebook.  However, I have
produced a number of reports of completed investigations in Jupyter Notebooks.
I have not yet attempted more complex or integrated use, and as such have
converted some of these to Markdown to reduce file sizes.


### Programming literacy

I am not a computer scientist or software engineer.  I have essentially learned
a bit of programming on the fly while studying mathematics, statistics, and
basic bioinformatics, while working at the CCG, while working at the ANPC, and
out of interest.  It has definitely opened up more of an interest in the field,
which I am happy to pursue, but I wouldn't call myself a software engineer by
any stretch of the imagination.  As of recently, I have been doing a lot more
programming work, in which I hope to learn more about the languages in use and
associated conventions, as well as some general computer science and best
practice.  My current focus at work is JavaScript, Ruby, and Julia.
