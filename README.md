# Code Examples
#### 2023-01-21


This repository shows a few bits and pieces of code I've written, in various
languages, both for work and out of interest.

Most of my experience is in R, I used to use Python quite a bit, and recently
I'm learning a bit of Julia and Rust.  I'm hoping to update some of the old
code soon, a lot it is early work from when I was first learning the languages!


## Personal background


I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Statistics, and have a few
years' experience using R.  I currently work as a Research Assistant in the
field of medical (epi)genetics, running risk prediction / modelling.  I've
mainly been writing wrappers for handling common workflows, as well as
converting existing scripts into configurable workflows and modifying
computation to run multi-threaded.  I'm also looking into replacing some code
with that of a supported statically-compiled language, such as using the Rcpp
or Extendr projects to improve performance in R projects.

I've worked with Python a bit, and with Julia somewhat.  Most of my work has
been with R, but I've tinkered with conversions and with smaller scripts using
Julia.  I'd like to use Julia more at work, and would like to learn more Rust
and use it at work, especially for improving runtime and memory usage and for
implementing multi-threaded computation.
