# Code Examples

README as at 2020-06-09.

Any constructive comments on how to improve my skills, knowledge, or best
practice are most welcome, provided that reasoning is given. For example,
instead of saying "Do it this way", I recommend providing a bit of reasoning and
logic to accompany it, e.g. "Do it this way, because it's faster / uses less RAM
/ is the common convention".

## Background

I typically work with R for statistics, and Python for testing at work. I have
otherwise been playing around with R for things like recording timesheets,
Python for things like implementations of the Syracuse and Euclid algorithms,
and have used bash for cleaning input (and providing a bit of fancy output) for
the youtube-dl program (just as a thought exercise, I guess). I've recently
started to play around with Ruby a little bit, and have uploaded some scripts
for a couple of things, including Syracuse and Euler implementations.

### R

I started using R in the first half of 2018, when I studied MAS224
Biostatistical Methods at Murdoch University, co-ordinated by Dr. Nicola J.
Armstrong. I have been using R for most semesters since studying this unit,
including for summer scholarship projects for Murdoch University and for the
Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute. Both projects were in veterinary
biostatistics, as is a current undergraduate project. The first project was an
investigation into factors affecting survival of dogs in veterinary trauma cases
presenting to emergency and critical care, mainly in the US. The second project
was a supplementary analysis for the application of a robust parameter
estimation technique in estimating hormone levels in equine blood plasma samples
to diagnose a common degenerative disorder. My work on this project resulted in
co-authorship on the paper (*Clinically and temporally specific diagnostic
thresholds for plasma ACTH in the horse*, Equine Veterinary Journal; manuscript
accepted). The current project aims to apply text mining techniques to a
national veterinary database to monitor vaccination scheduling for working dogs
in Australia.

### Python

I began using Python in mid-2019, shortly into my employment as Research
Assistant at the Centre for Comparative Genomics (CCG). I completed CSC2410
Computational Thinking with Python at the University of Southern Queensland, via
online study, in the second semester of 2019. Automated testing of the Rare
Disease Registry Framework primarily uses the Python packages Aloe and Selenium.
I have written scripts for automation of the Patient Reported Outcomes (PROMS)
surveys, which were modified to accept input data via CSV as requested by Lee
Render (see @id2359), using the Selenium package. I have recently been writing
new features and steps for extending current testing routines, including
introducing tests for an additional registry which was not previously covered,
using the Aloe framework. One example is provided here, currently. A number of
additional steps (and associated feature files) have been produced.

### Other languages

I am definitely open to learning more programming languages, though I have not
tried lower-level languages. I have tended to stick to high-level languages. As
such, while I am still curious to learn, it will likely take me quite a bit
longer to get the hang of, say, C or Fortran. For high-level languages, I have
been playing around with Ruby.

## Editor

I have changed editors a few times. I have worked with MATLAB, Octave, and
Jupyter Notebook when studying Mathematical Modelling. Otherwise, I have used
RStudio, Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Emacs. I like to use Emacs for most
things I'm currently doing, with the exception of R, for which I use RStudio
(mostly). I think I should learn vi, but there's quite a learning curve.

## Programming literacy

I am not a computer scientist or software engineer. I have essentially learned a
bit of programming on the fly while studying mathematics, statistics, and
bioinformatics, while working at the CCG, and out of interest. It has definitely
opened up more of an interest in the field, which I am happy to pursue, but I
wouldn't call myself a full-on software engineer. As of recently, I will be
doing more programming work, in which I hope to learn more about the languages
in use and associated conventions, as well as some general computer science and
best practice.
