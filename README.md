# Code Examples


README as at 2021-08-21.

Any constructive comments on how to improve my skills, knowledge, or best
practice are most welcome, provided that reasoning is given.  For example,
instead of saying "Do it this way", I recommend providing a bit of reasoning
and logic to accompany it, e.g. "Do it this way, because it's faster / uses
less RAM / is the common convention".


## The Short

I am a graduate mathematician and statistician, and I enjoy experimenting with
scripting languages.  Initially learning and using R while studying statistics,
then Python for study and work, I then tried Ruby and Julia.  In a previous job
I mostly used JavaScript and Ruby, and in my current position I am mostly using
Python and TypeScript.  My code-based work has generally involved data handling
and web interface design, and as it turns out I quite like object-oriented
scripting languages.  I'm certainly open to learning new languages, but it
might take me a bit longer to learn a lower-level language, like Java or C.


## The Long


### Personal background

I am a relatively recent graduate of a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and
Statistics, from Murdoch University, Perth, Western Australia, during which I
completed three projects in veterinary biostatistics.  I am currently a
Research Assistant at the Telethon Kids Institute, at the Perth Children's
Hospital (Perth, Western Australia).  Previous roles include Assistant Data
Analyst in a research unit at Murdoch University, based at Fiona Stanley
Hospital, and Research Assistant and the Centre for Comparative Genomics (CCG),
Murdoch University.

My home computer is a Raspberry Pi 4 with Ubuntu MATE and i3.  This is not the
computer I use at work, but is more than suitable for the vast majority of
things I do (even at work, possibly, but don't hold me to that).  All in all, I
adore the Raspberry Pi 4, and I only use it as a desktop computer, so I can
only imagine the possibilities for extension.


### Coding background


#### R

I first learned R when in my second year of my Bachelor's degree for a unit in
Biostatistical Methods, lectured by Dr. Nicola J. Armstrong.  Since then, I
have used R for a small number of projects in veterinary biostatistics.  The
first project was an investigation into factors affecting survival of dogs in
veterinary trauma cases presenting to emergency and critical care, mainly in
the US, but this was early into my learning, so I feel it could be greatly
improved.  The second project was a supplementary analysis for the application
of a robust parameter estimation technique in estimating hormone levels in
equine blood plasma samples to diagnose a common equine degenerative disorder.
My work on this project resulted in co-authorship on the paper (*Clinically and
temporally specific diagnostic thresholds for plasma ACTH in the horse*, Equine
Veterinary Journal; [doi:10.1111/evj.13292][paper0]) for extending the
visualisations produced for my presentation at the Australian Mathematical
Sciences Institute in early 2020.  The final project aimed to apply text mining
techniques to a national veterinary database to monitor vaccination scheduling
for working dogs in Australia.  I didn't get very far, and I would like to
improve upon it if I can find the time.

#### Python

Recently I have used Python quite a lot.  I originally learned Python at the
CCG, when writing automated behavioural UI tests using the Selenium and Aloe
packages, then extending my knowledge by taking the unit CSC2410 _Computational
Thinking with Python_ at the University of Queensland.  In my previous job, I
used Python for handling and processing large volumes of data using
multiprocessing operations.  That led on to an application in my current role
to handle multiple separate medical simulations across multiple cores, and I
also first started properly using class definitions in my current role.  Python
is easy to write and understand, and is very useful for quick testing and
modification for this kind of task.  It is difficult to think of any specific
examples to highlight, especially as most of my current work is contributed to
private repositories, but I may be able to provide some examples in future.

#### JavaScript

I quite like JS!  And I'm now learning TS, and a couple of associated web
frameworks.  Although I didn't use classes at all until after the end of my
previous job, I find JS is good to write and understand.  One major output
produced using JavaScript was a [force-directed graph visualisation, using the
D3 library][d3fdg].  Current work focuses on designing an interface for
semi-automated consolidation of data to assist other Research Assistants,
written in TypeScript and using a web framework.  The work is both privately
contributed and largely confidential, so no further detail can be provided
here.  Generally speaking, I quite like automated or reactive DOM generation,
and I am learning how to make it a bit better woven together, mainly for the
sake of data persistence and server interaction.


### Programming literacy


I am not a computer scientist or software engineer.  I have essentially learned
a bit of programming on the fly while studying mathematics, statistics, and
basic bioinformatics, at work, and out of interest.  It has definitely opened
up an interest in the field, which I am happy to pursue, but I wouldn't call
myself a software engineer by any stretch of the imagination.  As of recently,
I have been doing a lot more programming work, in which I hope to learn more
about the languages in use and associated conventions, as well as some general
computer science and best practice.  My current foci at work are Python and
TypeScript, but I may soon be learning Java.


#### Summary


In essence, I learned the basics of R when studying statstics, Python when
studying mathematical modelling and when working at the CCG, and Ruby when
working at the CCG and out of personal interest.  Recent work resulted in me
learning a bunch of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, mainly for data handling and
visualisation.  I can also provide documentation and reporting, and assistance
writing code, which I enjoy because I miss tutoring in mathematics and
statistics.

New frontiers are on the horizon, and I am eager to see what's next!
